## v0.1.0: A sovereign linux infrastructure

The goal of infrasov is to develop a sane standard for the soverign admin/business owner.

The goal is to put more power into the hands of the admin/business owner. For certain sectors of business, especially bitcoin - this level of sovereignty is a basic requirement.

As a whole, all considerations for PCI-DSS are covered in the overall infrastructure specification and guides.

The bitcoin section covers a glacier protocol-like hardware wallet interface with a full/pruned node configuration for complete
sovereign bitcoin operations.

Remember: not your keys -> not your coin.
