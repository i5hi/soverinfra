# soverinfra


## v0.1.0: A sovereign linux infrastructure

The goal of soverinfra is


- to develop a sane standard of technological operations (based on PCI-DSS ,ISO-27001, Glacier Protocol)

- to be a simple fork and customize solution for the sovereign business owner

- to put more power into the hands of the admin/business owner. For certain sectors of business, especially bitcoin - this level of sovereignty is a basic requirement.

***Remember: not your keys -> not your coin.***
